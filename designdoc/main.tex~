It takes in the names and entry numbers of team members through its user friendly GUI and sends it to the server when Submit button is pressed. It recieves the server response and shows it to the user. The application has error handling.

\item Methods to verify the user information: Highlight the errors handled by the code
\item  High	level	functions/methods	used and descrip2ons	of	each	one	

\item Methods for network communication. You can cite material that you used to create the application~\cite{android_network_tutorial}.
\end{itemize}
